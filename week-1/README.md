## Activities

* Addition and Subtraction of Numbers
  ** Calculate 10 - 19 , 20 + 30, 36 - 12 in signed, 1s and 2s complement.

  ** For signed binary numbers the most significant bit (MSB) is used as the sign bit. If the sign bit is 0, this means the number is positive in value. If the sign bit is 1, then the number is negative in value. The remaining bits in the number are used to represent the magnitude of the binary number.

  ** 10 can be represented in 8 bits  signed as 00001010 similary 19 is equivalent to 10010011
     
        00001010
     +  10010011
